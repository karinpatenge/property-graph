# General information

This folder contains a modified version of the CORA data set that works with Oracle DB 21c and earlier. The limitation in these versions of the Oracle Database is the number of allowed columns.  
As of Oracle Database 23c you can load the original data set including all columns of the CORA_CONTENT table.
