The Property Graph feature of Oracle Database offers powerful graph support for Oracle database, to explore and discover complex relationships in data sets such as customer data, social networks, and financial transactions, for applications in product recommendation, fraud detection, risk analysis, targeted marketing, and more.

This high performance Graph feature delivers advanced graph query language support, developer APIs, and analytics capabilities with nearly 60 pre-built algorithms.

The Property Graph features including the PGQL (Property Graph Query Language) support is available from Oracle Database 12.2 onward. Starting from Oracle Database Release 23c Free - Developer Release, you can also create and query property graphs using SQL, as defined in the SQL:2023 standard.

Oracle Graph Server and Client is a software package that works with the Property Graph feature in Oracle Database. It includes graph tools, client libraries, and Oracle Graph Server for running graph analytics algorithms. Oracle Graph Server and Client releases four times a year and its release version number is not related to the Oracle Database Release version number.

Graph Studio is an integrated, self-service tool to work with graphs. It includes:

* Automated graph modeling
* Extensive graph analytics and graph query support
* Advanced notebooks and integrated visualization
* Automated install, upgrade, and provisioning

Graph Studio is included in Autonomous Data Warehouse on Shared Infrastructure, and Autonomous Transaction Processing on Shared Infrastructure. It is not a part of Autonomous APEX or Autonomous JSON.
